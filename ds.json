        "description": "The Catalogue of Life is an assembly of expert-based global species checklists with the aim to build a comprehensive catalogue of all known species of organisms on Earth. Continuous progress is made towards completion, but for now, it probably includes just over 80% of the world's known species. The Catalogue of Life estimates 2.3M extant species on the planet recognised by taxonomists at present time. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient, and users may notice that many species are still missing from the Catalogue.\n\n### What's new in September 2024 edition?\n\n#### 86 checklists have been updated:\n\n* 3i Auchenorrhyncha\n* Bryonames\n* Entiminae\n* Gelechiidae\n* ITIS \n* Scarabs\n* SF Aphid\n* SF Chrysididae\n* SF Coreoidea\n* SF Dermaptera\n* SF Embioptera\n* SF Isoptera \n* SF Lygaeoidea \n* SF Mantodea \n* SF Orthoptera \n* SF Phasmida \n* SF Plecoptera \n* SF Psocodea \n* TITAN\n* WCO \n* WOL \n* WoRMS, 65 checklists\n\n####Other changes:\n* WCVP Lamiaceae was re-synced",

This backbone allows taxonomic search, browse and reporting operations across all those resources in a consistent way and to provide means to crosswalk names from one source to another.\", \"It is updated regulary through an automated process in which the Catalogue of Life acts as a starting point also providing the complete higher classification above families. Additional scientific names only found in other authoritative nomenclatural and taxonomic datasets are then merged into the tree, thus extending the original catalogue and broadening the backbones name coverage.          The GBIF Backbone taxonomy also includes identifiers for Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) drawn from the barcoding resources iBOL and UNITE.\", \"International Barcode of Life project (iBOL), Barcode Index Numbers (BINs).

        "description": "This is a checklist of Amphibian Species in the Kihansi Gorge in the Udzungwa Tanzania. It is an important information on Biodiversity status of the Udzungwa Mountains as a Mega Biodiverse Hotspot of the Eastern Arc Mountains. It contains endemic and species with the risk of extinction (endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild). The studies on amphibian species commenced with the discovery of the Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) (Nectophrynoides asperginis) in December 1996 and its description in 1998 (Poynton et al., 1998). To date several species of amphibians in the Order Anura in Five different Families have been identified to exist in the Kihansi Gorge. Unfortunately Nectophrynoides asperginis went extinct in the wild mainly due to habitat alteration by the Kihansi River water abstraction where water is used for Hydro power project. Further studies are underway to establish the exact cause of the population crash of KST in the Kihansi Gorge as one of the effort to bring back the KST population in the  wild. These include the studies on Chytrid fungus, sediments flush from the reservoir,agricultural pesticide residue and water quality changes. Thanks to the Captive breeding programs that the species is under control for reintroduction back to its original habitat. This description therefore intends to report the amphibians occurring in the Kihansi Gorge i.e. amphibians occurring in the Spray Wetlands, at the edges of the spray wetlands as well as those appearing in other areas of the gorge. These are important for testing different scientific scenarios related to KSTs disappearance in the Kihansi Gorge since 2003.",

Its purpose is to maintain species diversity and ecological balance. The government and related conservation organizations have designated 17 wildlife refuges. Not only are they the subject of academic researches, they are also the indicators of environmental quality. The checklist of Taiwan (TaiBNET) lists 238 endangered, rare, and other protected species of wildlife in Taiwan.

Among them, 8,000 are endemic species (including endemic subspecies and varietas), showing the abundance of Taiwan\u2019s endemic Species. TaiBNET also provides information on these species, such as their scientific names (including authors and years), common names, and synonyms. Through Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), the information on these endemic species are published and then shared and exchanged with other GBIF participants. Users can use keywords to link to other websites with relevant information.

Currently, the websites have been established at Academia Sinica (http://taibnet.sinica.edu.tw and http://www.gbif.org.tw). Both of the Biodiversity Research Center and the Computing Center of Academia Sinica are in charge of the maintenance and the updating biodiversity related information and data.\n\nThrough the node, the background of participating GBIF, related documents, news, upcoming conferences, name list of Taiwanese taxonomists, catalog of life in Taiwan, specimen database, biodiversity related organization, team research projects, independent biological databases, natural heritage, and local publications etc. can be accessed. Among them, \"Name list of Taiwanese taxonomists\" and \"Catalog of Life of Taiwan\" are one promoting project sponsored by the National Science Council. So far, 236 local taxonomists have included their titles, telephones, e-mail addresses, and the taxa that they are expertised. In the future, we hope to include all of the ecologists or the applied scientists in agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry in the name list.\n\nThe first phase of Catalog of Life in Taiwan will contain the following items of animals (including insects), plants, and fungi: species names, authors and year, suggested Chinese names, endemic in Taiwan or not, their classification hierarchy, the most authorized citation proving that particular species has occurred in Taiwan. Users can get the name list of one group of organisms through keywords search, species name searching, or image searching etc. Further information of each species can be obtained through the hyperlink to more than 18 well-known global databases or networks, such as Species2000 and ITIS etc. Right now, more than 30,000 species have been compiled, and we hope to collect more than 60,000 species by July 2004. Species checklist of the microorganisms will be included next year. We hope to get more funding and collaborators in the next phase to collect specimen or ecological photos (endemic species first), description (morphology, ecology and biology), geographical distribution, synonyms, literatures, as well as deposited specimen data for each species.\n\nThrough this node, the most authorized information of high biodiversity and endemism of Taiwan can be exchanged and shared with other GBIF participants. This mission is also requested by both of the Convention on Biological Diversity and GBIF to each member because in such a way, education, research, and conservation of biodiversity in the world could be promoted effectively.",

Animals, plants, fungi: you can make your way through a total of more than 32.000 species!\n\nThe Belgian species list was set up by the RBINS \u2013 the research institution behind the Museum of Natural Sciences \u2013 in cooperation with different Belgian and international institutions and organizations.\n\nThe purpose of the species list is to become the online reference in naming and occurrence of species in Belgium, easy to consult in just one website that centralizes and standardizes the information. For every species that's been described, information is given on among other things the conservation status, the distribution, the habitat and much more. More and more species index cards are fitted with pictures and interesting links.\n\nThe website is aimed at a broad audience: researchers, decision makers, students, journalists, nature conversationists and all nature lovers.\n\nWant to know more? \nLog on to www.species.be!",

The introduction in 1994 of a scientifically rigorous approach to determine risks of extinction that is applicable to all species, has become a world standard. In order to produce the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122, the IUCN Species Programme working with the IUCN Survival Commission (SSC) and with members of IUCN draws on and mobilizes a network of scientists and partner organizations working in almost every country in the world, who collectively hold what is likely the most complete scientific knowledge base on the biology and conservation status of species.",
